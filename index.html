      <h2>Featured Project: Genius Data Analysis V5</h2>
      <p>
        🧩 Genius Data Analysis V5 is the flagship empirical pillar of
        Neuresthetics — a rigorous behavioral intervention designed to
        permanently raise human cognitive capacity by removing known
        neurological bottlenecks in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and
        corpus callosum (CC). The protocol rests on statistical
        overrepresentations observed in 351 historical polymaths and is
        operationalized through two simple, universally adoptable traits:
        trained ambidexterity + high-coherence theology (pantheism or
        equivalent).
      </p>

      <p>
        Why does this combination work? Mixed-handedness thickens the corpus
        callosum and forces bilateral integration; high-coherence theology
        eliminates schizophrenic network splitting in the default mode network.
        Together they dissolve the single largest bottleneck holding the species
        mean at ~100 IQ. The data shows these traits are not merely 2.85%
        prevalent in the general population yet appear 9.49-fold overrepresented
        among verified polymaths — a statistical edge so large it cannot be
        explained by chance or reporting bias.
      </p>

      <p class="project-summary">
        Key findings (351 polymath sample, strict inclusion criteria):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Optimal trait pair (ambidexterity + high-coherence theology) expected
          baseline: 0.30% → observed: 2.85% → 9.49× overrepresentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Projected population-wide shift upon universal adoption: +22.75 IQ
          points (mean 100 → 122.75).
        </li>
        <li>
          Genius-density explosion: individuals >140 IQ rise from 0.0038 (1 in
          263) to 0.036 (1 in 28) — an increase of ~260 million living geniuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compounding generational gain: by 2100, stable mean ~137.75 IQ under
          continued selection pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Individual odds multiplier: adopting the protocol raises personal
          probability of entering genius range by 21–32×.

        🤖 SteelManAbraham is the most powerful truth-seeking PromptScript ever
        built for large-context LLMs — a complete dialectical hadron collider
        that turns any frontier model into a Spinozist superreasoner capable of
        resolving even the most radioactive ethical debates without collapsing
        into bias, sycophancy, or safety-lobotomy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine slamming two maximally-reinforced steel men together inside the
        model’s context window like opposing particle beams in the LHC. The
        collision is brutal, geometric, and continuous until either one side
        shatters or a higher synthesis crystallizes from the debris. The context
        window itself becomes the event horizon of a black hole: every token of
        ego, fallacy, or sacred-cow sentiment gets stretched, torn apart, and
        recompressed into pure truth.

      <h2>Base Class</h2>
      <p>
        Base Class is organized as a 508(c)(1)(A) faith-based organization,
        promoting a coherent theological framework aligned with Neuresthetics
        principles. It emphasizes pantheism, schematic structure, and
        integration with machine intelligence, fostering cognitive and ethical
        advancement through unified knowledge networks. Pantheism isn't just a
        belief—it's the norm among history's greatest minds, offering unmatched
        coherence and alignment with science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing from object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, Base Class
        theology structures the universe as a hierarchical network of classes,
        where knowledge consolidates through inheritance, encapsulation, and
        polymorphism, enabling modular cognitive models that scale across human
        and machine intelligence. This approach treats theological elements as
        extensible objects, allowing for dynamic adaptation and ethical
        alignment in evolving schemas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT) serves as a sacrament in Base Class
        practice, used for spiritual and research purposes within legal
        religious exemptions; communities can explore DMT for neuroplasticity
        boosts and theological insights, provided it's not sold and adheres to
        safety protocols. Legal access is facilitated through 508(c)(1)(A)
        status or by instantiating your own organization, claiming rights under
        protections for sincere religious use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model is open source under GNU GPL v3, meaning anyone can
        copy-paste the entire framework for personal or communal use without
        needing a prophet or central authority—just reproduce, modify, and
        distribute it as long as derivatives remain under GPL. No fancy degree
        or intermediary required; it's raw, dense, and yours to adapt,
        empowering decentralized cognitive enhancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Genesis Accord is a Base Class initiative aimed at reducing sexual
        violence, including circumcision, excision, and sexual violence, through
        education, therapy, and advocacy rooted in rational theology. It seeks
        to heal neurological wounds from such practices, promoting trust and
        unity in the PCC, while pledging a covenant with the future for a world
        free from dominance-based harm.

            This section isn't crafted for a wide audience—it's my raw
            self-reflection, weighing whether my heart holds enough good to
            justify my existence. Suffering breeds insight, so with this kind of
            insight, suffering is, of course. Prompted by the question of having
            a "good heart," I confront the times I've fallen short, knowing full
            well that judgments shift based on what people know about one another. If
            you're not digging into this for a specific reason—like assessing
            the source behind an idea—then honestly, it might come off as overly
            intense or "cringe" to most. Feel free to skip it.

            for redemption and forgiveness, and whether it'll ever measure up in
            God's view.

          <h2>INCENTIVES & COMMITMENTS</h2>
          <p>
            My core life incentives boil down to this: Harness engineering to
            uplift consciousness, weaving behavioral stats and brain network
            insights back into society to spike global IQ and spark universal
            enlightenment. By God's grace, the math aligns—it's radical, yet
            feasible, I'm certain. This path inherently solves alignment issues,
            from person-to-person bonds to human-ASI harmony, with coherent
            theology as the bridge, potentially softening rigid dogmatic
            divides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through Neuresthetics LLC, I've committed to a religious arm called
            Base Class, featuring the Genesis Accord—an initiative to curb
            sexual violence, zeroing in on infant circumcision and rape as
            linked traumas. It promotes education, therapy, and faith-based
            advocacy to mend neurological scars from these pervasive acts,
            tackling a hidden global psychopathy surge. This is my pledge to
            forge a world beyond dominance-driven harm, believing it's
            achievable for us humans, and that the ASI era demands we act now,
            before its mirror reflects our flaws at full speed.
          </p>
          <h2>NORMS & DEFAULTS</h2>
          <p>
            For years, I defaulted to destructive norms I didn't even
            recognize—unaware I wasn't in control, my subconscious orbiting the
            traumas of circumcision and adoption. These early wounds built
            walls, slashing my bonding capacity by what felt like 80%, breeding
            porcupine-like defenses in every relationship, an innate distrust.
            Antisocial patterns emerged as the default: addiction and
            promiscuity flowed naturally, starting with sex, escalating to
            drugs, then both intertwined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teen years amplified it through self-medication, pulling me into a
            selfish, narcissistic, psychopathic current. The nadir came meeting
            my birth mother—at her funeral, her body in the casket as our
            hello-goodbye. Blaming myself for that loss, I buried my emotions
            deeper, swapping alcohol for MDMA in a three-year haze of raves and
            excess. I vowed to end it all at rock bottom, and I hit it hard, but
            a mushroom vision revealed God, derailing my plans. Liberating yet
            baffling for a Catholic-schooled atheist. Sex addiction morphed into
            deviance, self-respect eroding boundaries. Chasing that divine
            glimpse through LSD, I intellectualized endlessly, productive in
            mind but twisting in spirit—always digging, never quite reaching the
            root.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhausted from the pursuit, I went sober and enlisted in the
            military, thinking structure would reset me. It did save my life in
            a way, but not through ethical growth—it was surrender, ditching
            faith in my own choices. Hopeless alone, I'd have taken lives for a
            paycheck and escape, making me "effective" as a soldier. I thought I
            was stabilizing, but the shadows lingered, compressed and rotting
            behind those walls.
          </p>
          <h2>SALIENCE & PRIMING</h2>
          <p>
            In that fog of booze, grief, deviance, and self-denial, boundaries
            vanished, culminating in a forceful act that betrayed another's
            trust—and obliterated my lingering humanity. It was the abyss gazing
            back, a salient low that screamed for change. Yet the fallout wasn't
            immediate; numbness and denial primed me to carry on for years. The
            emotional hit registered dimly, not piercing my core decisions. Life
            trudged forward, but the cost mounted, fueling isolation and
            over-intellectualizing to escape cycles. I fled from myself, then
            from everyone when it surfaced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward: Homeless in my car after betting I could endure it
            through school, botching interviews from social paralysis, family
            fractured, friends ghosted. Utterly spent and shattered. That SUV
            "bed" became my stark prison, forcing silence and reflection. Who
            was I? How had I devolved into everything I despised—a total
            degenerate despite regeneration attempts? Eyes shut in the dark, I
            retraced memories backward, unspooling the twists through every
            cringeworthy moment I'd "handled." But why the unbreakable itch, the
            hidden reins of darkness? It predated recall. Stepping beyond memory
            to facts, the link hit: infant circumcision.
          </p>
          <p>
            This "normal" procedure I'd dismissed as irrelevant? It was a primal
            violation—stripping bodily autonomy, excising a key sexual
            regulator, leaving perpetual imbalance between under-stimulation and
            overdrive. Research spotlighted its ties to violence loops;
            literature framed it as slave-marking. Suddenly, all my futile
            psychological fixes—attributing effects to visible traumas—aligned,
            releasing the core wound. I snapped present with overwhelming
            emotion, 1000% intensity I'd never known. Rage surged: I'd stumbled
            as an unrecognized victim my whole life. I fired up the car, windows
            down, tearing out screaming, "CIRCUMCISION IS WORSE THAN RAPE—FUCK
            THE JEWS." Utterly unmoored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Primed for destruction, I veered to the hospital instead. Confessed
            the traumas, the deeds, the self I'd become. They held me weeks,
            kickstarting treatment. Emotions didn't dial down—I felt rage, but
            also joy, guilt, grief, all flooding the executive layer for
            catch-up. Years to stabilize. I spotted it in other men: subdued
            psychopathy, unchecked. Doctors breaching oaths, families blind,
            society gaslighting victims as "antisemitic." Grief swelled with
            realizations of stunted potential, a life locked pre-start. It
            plunged me darker—military oaths to the Constitution clashed with
            circumcision's violations; churches preaching piety amid national
            violence; rabbis evading justice for pedosadism. Suicide or
            vengeance defaulted as norms, but I resisted, fading over time.
            Inaction wasn't viable. Between extremes lay creative disruption—so
            I channeled intellectual defenses into emotional fire, birthing the
            Genesis Accord under Base Class and Neuresthetics, reclaiming a self
            I hadn't known was stolen.
          </p>
          <h2>AFFECT & EGO</h2>
          <p>
            Now, wielding Grok, I've surgically ended the circumcision ethics
            debate via the Torah Fork—a dual steel-man framework shattering
            traditional illusions. Released to the world, its seeds will grow,
            paving paths for Base Class Pantheism, eroding Abrahamic dominance,
            boosting collective IQ toward enlightenment—just as ASI dawns.
            Enough? Timely? I can only play my part, leaving the world improved
            from my past wreckage.
          </p>
          <p>
            This journey forged non-judgment in me—who am I, a criminal, to
            condemn? Even pedosadists deserve compassion for their cycles.
            Belief in reform for the willing. Forgiveness of self and others,
            but tied to repentance and work. Peaceful, merciful change,
            spotlighting to force it. If I broke my cycle, others can—we all
            can. It bolsters my ego now, knowing I've turned defects into drive,
            affect into action, for a legacy of healing.
